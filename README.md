Stacked consolidates the information from all of the Cornell libraries into a singular user-friendly interface. Stacked provides details on 
library opening hours, amenities, locations, and more. Much of the library data was web scraped using the SwiftSoup package. Download the current 
release on the [App Store](http://thompsonng.blogspot.com/2012/03/xcode-remove-local-git-repository.html).
